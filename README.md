# FrequencyAnalysis4Doc
Perform frequency analysis on documents.

A simple program that performs basic frequency analysis that shows the user the distribution of letters used within a text file. This program can work in the terminal or by using the graphical user interface. To run in just the terminal, simple just run "java Main". To get the GUI option, add any command line arguement, such as "java Main g" or "java Main a". That input arguement doesnt matter.

Things to do:
- Clean up output.
  - Output in command line can be formatted to to just display a limited number of digits.
  - Output in GUI needs major cleaning up with proper formatting and better spacing. May have to move off of using a message dialog to a new view.
